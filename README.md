# Achiever
Various files for Achiever bot, running on the Dudes Abiding discord server.

If you want to test the commands, it's best to do it in the `#bunny` channel. Games should probably be done in `#vegas`. Music should be done in `#voice-text`. Thanks.

The bot prefix is "d." (without quotes). Example: `d.help` gives you the main help text.
